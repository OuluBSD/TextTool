I want to break free from these chains,\nfind my own track and leave you behind, like a train.\nBut every time we try, it's like throwing gasoline on a flame,\njust adding more fuel to this burning game.\nBut every time we try, it's like two trains on a collision course,\nour love's a breaking force that leaves us both feeling remorse.\n\nVerse 2:\nOur love was like a train, always heading off the tracks,\nnever knowing when the next collision would bring us back.\nBut every time we try, we're just chasing our own tails,\nstuck in this endless game that always fails.\nBut I can't shake this feeling, this emotional ride,\nit's like a drug that I can't deny, no matter how hard I've tried.\nBut as the tracks unravel, we're left with just the scars,\ncaught in this endless dance of push and pull in a crowded bar.\n\nVerse 3:\nAnd as we keep spinning in this vicious dance,\nI can't help but wonder if our love stood a chance.\nWe were always caught between love and pain,\nriding a rollercoaster that never seemed to end.\nBut as we keep spinning in this vicious dance, I realize it's time to take a chance,\nand break free from this endless trance.\nOn this journey of love and pain, we've danced a thousand times, but it's time to break this endless cycle,\nand find a love that truly shines.\n\n",
